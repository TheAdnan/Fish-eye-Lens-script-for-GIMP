# Fish-eye Lens script for GIMP
Fish-eye Lens script written in Scheme for GIMP. The script creates a cheap Go-Pro camera Fish-eye lens effect. You can optionally turn off the adjusting of the levels of the image before the script executes (I've added it for experimental purposes)

## Instalation:
1. Download the .scm file from this repository and place it inside of your script folder in your GIMP installation
2. Restart GIMP or go to *Filters-> Script-Fu -> Refresh Scripts*
3. The script is located at *Filters-> Enhance -> Fish-eye effect by Kicin*
